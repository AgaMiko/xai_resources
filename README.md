## Papers

### 2018

* [Manifold: A Model-Agnostic Framework for Interpretation and Diagnosis of Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00196.pdf); Jiawei Zhang, Yang Wang, Piero Molino, Lezhi Li and David S. Ebert; Intoduces Manifold - tool for visual exploration of a model during  inspection (hypothesis), explanation (reasoning), and refinement (verification). Supports comparison of multiple models. Visual exploratory approach for machine learning model development.

### 2016 

* [Interacting with Predictions: Visual Inspection of Black-box Machine Learning Models](http://perer.org/papers/adamPerer-Prospector-CHI2016.pdf); Josua Krause, Adam Perer, Kenney Ng; Describes Prospector - tool for visual exploration of predictive models. Few interesting and novel ideas, like Partial Dependence Bars. Prospector can compare models and shows both local and global explanations.

### 2004
